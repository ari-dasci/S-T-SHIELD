Introduction
=================================

T-SHIELD (Transformation-Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics) is a regularization 
technique that approach aims to enhance model interpretability while improving model performance.
Specifically, T-SHIELD adds a regularization term to the
objective function of a model optimization loss that penalizes the model if it relies too heavily on
a small subset of input features.


T-SHIELD is a regularization family that can be used with any model that can be trained
using gradient descent. It is implemented in Python and is available as a package that
can be installed with this repo.
